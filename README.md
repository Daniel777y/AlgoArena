## Usage

This project is still in development phase, so it doesn't really support user system yet. To use it, you can go to the settings page, type your email and "Login". It lists all the users in the system, you can choose one to login as.

Then you can link to your online judges accounts. Currently, we support Codeforces and LeetCode. I will add more online judges and require verification in the future.

You can link multiple accounts to the same user. The system will calculate your average rating based on all linked accounts.

In the home page, you can see your ratings of all linked accounts and check the upcoming contests.

In the ranking page, you can see all users' average ratings and rank them.
